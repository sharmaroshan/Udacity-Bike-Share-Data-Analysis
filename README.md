# Udacity-Bike-Share-Data-Analysis
This was literally the first project that I have ever made, This is from Udacity's Python Nano degree Program. The data set consists of the bike sharing data for the big cities of United States, as it was my first project. I have done a very basic solution for it. 



# Context
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. With the latest technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used. The data consists of BikeShare information for three large cities in the US - New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC.
